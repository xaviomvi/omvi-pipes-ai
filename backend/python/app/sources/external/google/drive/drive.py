The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.create` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `"name": "cat.jpg"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.

This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering. * `modifiedByMeTime`: The last time the file was modified by the user. * `modifiedTime`: The last time the file was modified by anyone. * `name`: The name of the file. This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering, so 1, 12, 2, 22. * `name_natural`: The name of the file. This field is sorted using natural sort ordering, so 1, 2, 12, 22. * `quotaBytesUsed`: The number of storage quota bytes used by the file. * `recency`: The most recent timestamp from the file's date-time fields. * `sharedWithMeTime`: When the file was shared with the user, if applicable. * `starred`: Whether the user has starred the file. * `viewedByMeTime`: The last time the file was viewed by the user.
